# Scion Agent Management Skill

Scion is a container-based orchestration tool for managing concurrent LLM-based code agents. It enables parallel execution of specialized sub-agents with isolated identities, credentials, and workspaces.

## Core Concepts

### Projects
A **project** is the grouping construct for agents in scion.

### Agents
An **agent** is an isolated LLM instance running in a container with a mounted workspace, credentials, and configuration.

### Templates
**Templates** are blueprints for creating agents.

### Harnesses
A **harness** is the LLM interface (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, etc.) that the agent uses.

## Command Reference

The best and most current reference for the CLI commands is available from `scion --help`. Some best practices are in the scion-cli-operations skill.

## Tips for Agents

1. **Check existing agents first**: Before starting a new agent, use `scion list` to see what's already running.

2. **Use descriptive names**: Agent names should reflect their purpose (e.g., `refactor-auth`, `test-api`, `audit-security`).

3. **Choose appropriate templates**: Use `--type researcher` for a researcher.

4. **Monitor with logs**: Use `scion logs <agent>` to check progress without interrupting.

5. **Interrupt carefully**: The `--interrupt` flag on messages stops current work - use only when necessary.

6. **Preserve branches**: When deleting agents whose work might need review, use `--preserve-branch`.
